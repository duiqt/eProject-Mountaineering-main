            <h1>Hazards to Be Aware Of Mountain Climbing</h1>
            <p>Mountain climbing is an inherently dangerous activity, and you need to be aware of the dangers before you
                go out. So, what are the main risks in mountain climbing? Falling, avalanche danger, exposure to the
                elements, and altitude sickness are among the most prevalent risks that you’ll face while mountaineering, although
                that’s far from a comprehensive list. There’s a whole host of mountain climbing risks that you’ll have
                to face if you decide to take up this sport. Some of them (like falling and exhaustion) you’ll have to content with every time you go mountain
                climbing, while others (like altitude sickness) will only become relevant once you start pushing the
                boundaries on some of the hardest mountains in the world. Now, this article isn’t meant to dissuade you from mountain
                climbing (I do it all the time, and I love it), but rather to make you aware of the dangers so that you can plan for them!
            </p>

            <h2>The Dangers of Mountain Climbing</h2>
            <div><img src="img/img hazard/Top20.png" alt="Top20" width="90%"></div>

            <p>Even though I’ve spent most of my life climbing mountains, I still don’t think that I was able to create
                a fully comprehensive list including all of the dangers that you’ll face. With that being said, though,
                I have
                20 main ones that you should be planning for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Falling:</b> Maybe the most common danger, and one that almost everyone is afraid of.</li>
                <li><b>Avalanches:</b> Avalanches can hit you at any time, and even the best mountaineers in the world sometimes succumb to them.</li>
                <li><b>Weather:</b> Weather patterns in the mountains change quickly, and you can find yourself stuck if
                    the conditions suddenly turn.</li>
                <li><b>Exposure:</b> Spending tens of hours in the beating sun or freezing cold can start to mess with
                    your body and brain (I recently dropped a rappel device due to heat stroke).</li>
                <li><b>Hypothermia:</b> Spending too long in the cold will cause your body to start to shut down.</li>
                <li><b>Altitude sickness:</b> Not getting enough oxygen to your brain can muddle your thinking and cause
                    fever-like symptoms</li>
                <li><b>Pulmonary Edema:</b> A specific type of altitude sickness where blood builds up in your lungs.
                </li>
                <li><b>Cerebral Edema:</b> An even worse form of altitude sickness, where blood builds up in your brain.
                </li>
                <li><b>Exhaustion:</b> Tiring yourself out can lead to poor decision making, falls, and injuries</li>
                <li><b>Rockfall:</b> Due to erosion and temperature change, chunks of rock will come loose. Once hit
                    from these could easily kill you.</li>
                <li><b>Icefall:</b> Similar to above, except this time with ice.</li>
                <li><b>Snow blindness:</b> When the sun reflects off the snow, it sometimes becomes so bright that it
                    causes temporary loss of eyesight.</li>
                <li><b>Crevasses:</b> Cracks in glaciers that can be up to hundreds of feet deep. A fall into one of
                    these can be life-ending.</li>
                <li><b>Broken equipment:</b> Although this rarely happens, it can leave you stranded when it does.</li>
                <li><b>Navigational errors:</b> If you end up in the wrong place while mountain climbing, your situation
                    could turn out a lot more dangers than you planned.</li>
                <li><b>Summit Fever:</b> Becoming obsessedwith your goal can lead to poor decision making, accidents,
                    and exhaustion.</li>
                <li><b>Injury:</b> Whether it’s a twisted ankle, a broken bone, or a concussion, unforeseen injuries can
                    strand you while mountain climbing.</li>
                <li><b>Animals:</b> Wild animals like bears, cougars, and wolves need to be taken into account when
                    climbing mountains.</li>
                <li><b>Hunger and Dehydration:</b> Not giving your body enough fuel to operate on can wear you down.
                </li>
                <li><b>Carelessness:</b> Becoming overconfident or over relaxed is a death sentence while mountain
                    climbing (especially if combined with any of the other factors.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>As you can see, there’s a long list of risks to be aware of while mountain climbing. Knowing about them
                is important — but knowing how to avoid them is even more so.</p>

            <div>

                <h2>Falling</h2>
                <div><img src="img/img hazard/Falling.jpg" alt="Falling" width="90%"></div>

                <div class="what">
                    <p><b>What it is:</b> The risk of losing your purchase on the mountain in a steep section and having
                        gravity do the rest.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="danger">
                    <p> <b>Why it’s dangerous:</b> Above five feet, you might injure yourself in a fall; above 20,
                        there’s a very realchance that you could die.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="how">
                    <p><b>How to avoid it:</b> Strong mental capacity, navigation, and knowing your limits are all
                        important factors to avoid falling.<br> Wearing a helmet can lessen the impact of a fall.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Falling is one of the baseline fears that humans face, and for good reason. A fall from as little
                        as ten feet is enough to suffer a life-changing injury, so this is something you want to avoid
                        at all costs.
                    </p>
                    <p>Often while mountain climbing you find yourself in ‘no-fall zones’ — areas where you don’t have
                        any protection (ropes, harnesses, etc.) and a fall would result in death. In such situations,
                        it’s essential to know that you’re within your own personal limits before you enter the no fall zone.
                    </p>
                    <p>Reading route descriptions, listening to more experienced people, and practicing on easier
                        terrain will all allow you to judge mountains and know if you’re good enough to venture into
                        their no-fall zones without pushing yourself too far.</p>

                <h2>Avalanches</h2>
                <div><img src="img/img hazard/Avalanches.jpg" alt="Avalanches" width="90%"></div>

                <div class="what">
                    <p><b>What it is:</b> Massive packs of snow that come loose from mountains and slide down, sometimes
                        for thousands of feet, at almost 100 miles per hour.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="danger">
                    <p><b>Why it’s dangerous:</b> Avalanches can bury you alive in snow and then trap you there until
                        you suffocate (that’s if they don’t crush you to death first).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="how">
                    <p><b>How to avoid it:</b> There are two steps to avoiding avalanches: proper planning (not
                        venturing into severe avalanche terrain) and proper recovery (having the right tools and
                        partners to dig you out if you ever do get trapped).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Of all the things on this earth, avalanches scare me the most. That’s not even an exaggeration;
                        the thought of being trapped in a snowy tomb, slowly running out of air while I’m unable to
                        breath, keeps me up at night.</p>
                    <p>Avalanches are one of those uncontrollable risks that you can plan for, but you can’t do too much
                        to prevent. Often times they’re caused by factors that are completely out of your control, so
                        the only thing for you to do is to try to avoid avalanche terrain at all costs.</p>
                    <p>Of course, sometimes this isn’t possible, and you need to enter avalanche terrain to climb a
                        specific route. In these cases, even the best mountain climbers in the world are unable to
                        prevent tragedy. Alex Lowe, one of the greatest mountaineers of all time, died in a massive
                        unforeseeable avalanche.</p>

                <h2>Weather</h2>
                <div><img src="img/img hazard/Weather.jpg" alt="" width="90%"></div>

                <div class="what">
                    <p><b>What it is:</b> The risk of sudden weather changes (usually in the form of storms), which
                        happen often in the mountains.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="danger">
                    <p><b>Why it’s dangerous:</b> Storms can change the conditions you’re in, which makes your
                        travelling harder and may expose you to the elements.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="how">
                    <p><b>How to avoid it:</b> Good planning and preparation are the only way to avoid this danger. You
                        should know the weather report for your specific mountain before you leave the house, and you
                        should always carry one extra layer of clothing on you (and one extra meal in case you get
                        stranded).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Weather risks are mostly related to the chance that you get caught in an unforeseen storm while
                        mountain climbing. This can expose you to the elements (leading to issues like hypothermia) and
                        can make travelling more difficult (if you crossed a narrow ridge on your way to the summit in
                        calm conditions, trying to backtrack across it when faced with wind and rain will be a lot more
                        difficult).</p>
                    <p>This is why climbers on Everest wait so long for a good weather window before they push to the
                        summit; trying to climb in the middle of a storm is so difficult that it may as well be a death
                        sentence.</p>
                    <p>There’s nothing you can really do here except plan ahead. Try to get an accurate idea of what the
                        weather on a given day will look like, and then overpack for that weather. If you think you’ll
                        need one sweater, bring two. If it’s calling for sun, bring a rain jacket. Of course, if the
                        weather looks bad, you should just stay home and plan to try again another day.</p>

                <div class="how">
                    <p><b>How to avoid it:</b> Again, there’s nothing to do except to over-plan and over-prepare. Bring
                        extra layers if it’s supposed to be cold, and extra water if it’s supposed to be hot.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Recently, while on a multi-pitch rock climb, I spent about two hours standing around in 35-degree
                        (Celsius) weather without any water while exerting myself on a difficult climb. Half an hour
                        later, when trying to rappel, I dropped my belay device and had to perform an emergency rappel.
                    </p>
                    <p>Exposure to the elements can muddle your thinking and make it hard for you to function. Too long
                        in the sun and you’ll get a heatstroke (like I did). Too long in the cold, and you might be

                    <p><b>How to avoid it:</b> I’m starting to sound like a broken record here, but you need to plan if

                <div class="content">

                    <p>Hypothermia is one of the main dangers that mountain climbers have to contend with. When you
                        spend too long in the cold, your blood gets thick and your body eventually starts to shut down, which can have
                        some pretty disastrous consequences.</p>
                    <p>Avoiding this comes down to four things:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dressing properly: Layers, layers, layers. Always bring more clothes than you need.</li>
                        <li>Calories: Having food in your stomach or a hot drink is an excellent way to combat
                            hypothermia.
                        </li>

                        <li>Awareness: One of the dangers of hypothermia is that it sneaks up on you. It can muddle your
                            thinking and confuse you to the point where you actually feel warm and relaxed, even though
                            you’re
                            freezing to death. Keeping your wits about you will help you stave off the hypothermia
                            instead of succumbing to it.

                    <p>The only way to really avoid this is to take good care of the gear that you use, and only use it
                        for what it’s designed to do. Don’t use your ice axe as a crowbar or try to hammer in a piton
                        with a crampon.</p>
                    <p>Home care is also important; make sure you’re properly washing, drying, and storing all of your
                        essential equipment. Finally, make sure to inspect your gear regularly so that you can tell if
                        any of it is nearing the end of its lifecycle.</p>

                    <p>Story time: earlier this summer, I got lost while scrambling a mountain, went way off trail,
                        ended up in some (very) steep terrain without a rope, and had to be helicopter rescued off.</p>
                    <p>If that doesn’t illustrate the value of good navigation, I don’t know what will. Finding and
                        staying on your desired trail, as well as learning how to pick the easiest route through
                        difficult terrain, can go a long way in keeping you safe.</p>
                    <p>Thankfully, modern technology has done a lot in this area. Handheld GPSs are accurate to almost a
                        meter, and you can pre-load topographical maps onto them. Even better, there are some apps out
                        there (like GAIA or AllTrails) that will do the same thing for your smartphone.</p>
                    <p>I used to be a map-and-compass snob, but after my helicopter incident, I highly recommend a GPS.

                    <p>Summit fever may sound like an absurd concept, but it’s a very real risk for mountain climbers.
                        You spend months or years training for a specific peak only to find yourself 200 meters from the
                        summit. The only thing that stands between you and your goal is a narrow, exposed ridge — and it
                        looks like a storm is starting to blow in.</p>
                    <p>In this situation, it’s so hard to pull the plug, turn around, and make the right decision. With
                        the summit so close, you feel like you deserve to get there because of all the work you’ve put
                        in.</p>
                    <p>It’s important to remember, though, that getting there could quite literally cost you your life.
                        Mountains are incredibly dangerous, and mistakes compound with shocking speed.</p>
                    <p>To avoid this, you need to reframe your mindset to stop yourself from becoming obsessed with the
                        summit.</p>

                    <p>Now, obviously, injuries are bad because they can kill you (like getting whacked in the head with
                        a really big rock). When on the mountains, though, even small injuries can really complicate
                        your situation and put your life in danger.</p>
                    <p>Take, for example, a twisted ankle, which isn’t life threatening on its own, but can put you in a
                        pretty bad scenario. If you can’t walk, you’re stranded until help comes; this means you have to
                        spend longer on the mountain and more time exposed to the weather, cold, rockfall, and avalanche
                        risk.</p>
                    <p>There’s no one way to avoid injuries, so I would just say have a heightened sense of awareness

                    <p>Animals are more of a risk for causal mountain climbs, where you’re not in alpine terrains.
