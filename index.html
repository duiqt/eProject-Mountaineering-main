                <p>Paraclimbing is Sport Climbing for athletes with disabilities. Athletes are placed into a <a
                        href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/paraclimbing/classification" target="_blank">Sport
                        Class</a> Sport
                    Class based on their disability, to allow those with a disability of a similar nature to compete
                    within the same category.<br>

                    The IFSC has been hosting Paraclimbing competitions since 2006, when the first international event
                    saw athletes from four National Federations compete in Ekaterinburg, Russia. The movement has grown
                    in recent years, with a regular circuit being added to the IFSC calendar from 2010 and IFSC
                    Paraclimbing World Championships taking place from July 2011. It has become tradition that the IFSC
                    Paraclimbing World Championships run alongside the IFSC Climbing World Championships, promoting
                    athletes with a disability on the same stage as other athletes. Proud of the rapid growth of the
                    Paraclimbing community, and of the increasing standard of competitions, the IFSC remains dedicated
                    to developing and strengthening the competitions and support available to athletes.<br>

                    In 2017, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) granted the IFSC the status of “Recognised
                    International Federation”.<br>

                latter taking place every even year and including up to 72 athletes from 20 different countries.

                The Paraclimbing Commission (disbanded in 2019) made various modifications to the Paraclimbing Rule and
                Event Format. The Classification system was expanded up to 10 theoretical categories for men and women
                to ensure a fair competition.

                    “new normal” at climbing gyms around the world. (Photo courtesy of The Spot)</small>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-7" style="text-align: justify;">

                <p>CBJ published that Gyms and Trends article in February, 2020. Approximately one month later,
                    operations in the climbing industry in North America—and throughout the world— began to change
                    drastically. A new factor emerged that became widespread and impactful at a scale never seen before
                    in the modern gym climbing era. Indeed, the COVID-19 pandemic hit with full force, and its major
                    effects are still challenging the climbing industry nearly one year later.</p> <br>
                <p>
                    That first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic stateside in March 2020 proved to be as destructive as it
                    was unpredictable. Gym attendance everywhere plummeted as people became increasingly cognizant (and
                    in some cases increasingly fearful) of the Coronavirus’ transmissibility. Related to the gym
                    industry, the Tokyo Olympics—where climbing was set to make its highly-publicized debut—were
                    postponed. The annual Climbing Wall Association (CWA) Summit was cancelled and CWA, as the
                    industry’s trade association, shifted to providing ongoing pandemic-related resources and support,
                    including a roadmap for reopening.
                </p>

            </div>


        </div>
        <p>
            To that point, the pandemic unified the industry, in a way, as gyms showed transparency in
            exchanging information on CWA community calls and surveys, sharing protocols and data, offering
            lessons learned and further problem solving together. In the United States, practically every
            climbing gym in every state was deemed a “non-essential business” and forced to temporarily close at
            some point in the spring or summer of 2020 as the Coronavirus continued to spread around the
            country. Gyms eventually reopened with significant mitigation measures (such as reservation
            time-slots, required face-masks, lowered capacities, and enforced social distancing…all of which
            contributed to a “new normal” for the climbing gym experience).
        </p>


        <p>
            Such collectivism by gyms was hardly a long-term silver lining, however; many gyms were forced to
            temporarily close again in the fall of 2020 as another wave of the COVID-19 pandemic surged; some of those
            gyms even chose to remain open, going against mandatory municipal orders and risking serious legal
            penalties—all in an attempt to stay financially afloat.
        </p>
        <p>
            The temporary closure of so many gyms amid stay-at-home orders did result in a boom for the homewall tier of
            the climbing industry. As early as April, CBJ announced that the “Era of Home Climbing Walls” had arrived.
            Indeed, 67 percent of homewall owners responding to an <a
                href="https://www.climbingbusinessjournal.com/strati-climbing-home-wall-survey/" target="_blank">October
                survey</a>
            answered that they built their homewall in response to the pandemic. And since it is unlikely that many new
            homewallers will choose to quickly disassemble their walls in a post-pandemic world, this widespread
            interest in homewalls―as well as the uptick in at-home fitness offerings provided by gyms―will likely remain
            a key part of the industry going forward.

                    more than six months in 2019 – which certainly gives him some pretty high credentials in the world
                    of mountaineering.<br>
                    The former Gurkha and soldier of the Special Boat Service (SBS) climbed Everest, Lhotse and Makalu
                    within two days and 30 minutes and smashed the previous 14 summits record of seven years, 11 months
                    and 14 days. In 2021 he was part of a team that completed the first summit of K2 in winter,
                    something that was often referred to as 'the last great mountaineering challenge.'

                        <p> Until 1852, Kangchenjunga was assumed to be the highest mountain in the world, but
                            calculations based on various readings and measurements made by the Great Trigonometrical
                            Survey of India in 1849 came to the conclusion that Mount Everest, known as Peak XV at the
                            time, was the highest. Allowing for further verification of all calculations, it was
                            officially announced in 1856 that Kangchenjunga is the third highest mountain in the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Kangchenjunga was first climbed on 25 May 1955 by Joe Brown and George Band, who were part
                            of the 1955 British Kangchenjunga expedition. They stopped short of the summit in accordance
                            with the promise given to the Chogyal that the top of the mountain would remain inviolate.

                    <p>This Alpine peak spans the border between Switzerland and Italy. At 4,478 metres it’s smaller
                        than the famed Mont Blanc (4,810 metres), but its striking pyramidal shape – not to mention its
                        spot overlooking the cosy Swiss ski town of Zermatt – makes it the poster child for the Alps.
                    </p>
                    <p>Matterhorn was first scaled in 1865, with Brit Edward Whymper credited as the initial person to
                        reach the summit. His triumph was bitter sweet, though, since four climbers in Whymper’s
                        seven-strong team plunged to their deaths during their descent.</p>
                    <p>Today, upwards of 2,000 hardy folks ascend the peak each year. If you’re determined to be one of
                        them, the Hörnli ridge route is the most popular and is best attempted in summer. Don’t
                        underestimate the challenge, listen to your guide and make sure you’re kitted out, crampons and
                        all. Otherwise, take a funicular ride from Zermatt to Rothorn for jaw-dropping views without the
                        climb.</p>
