                Safe and effective climbing experience requires preparing the necessary equipment. Things to bring when
                climbing include: <br> <br>
                <b>2.1. Water and food</b> <br>
                Climbing is a physical activity, sweating a lot, so the body needs to be hydrated regularly. When
                climbing is tired, do not drink continuously or large water because it will make the body uncomfortable.
                You should drink water drop by drop and from the beak down. In order not to make the journey, you can
                hang the water bottle before you go and drink. In addition to drinking water, maintaining physical
                fitness is also very important. Instead of oven baked goods, which takes time, you can eat high-quality
                foods such as chocolate, snicker cake or dry food, which is both quick and easy to carry. <br> <br>

                <b>2.2. Climbing clothes</b> <br>
                The climbing experience for beginners is to choose light clothes, with good elasticity, sweat absorption
                and quick perspiration. In addition, clothes with sunscreen and deodorant features should also be
                prioritized to wear when climbing. <br>

                <b>3.1. Short roads suitable for ability</b> <br>
                When you first start climbing, you should not choose a long journey because your physical strength will
                certainly not be enough. Not only that, if you do not have experience in climbing, you should not
                participate in a long journey because you will not be able to ensure that the entire trip is smooth and
                safe. Therefore, beginners should choose for themselves a short climbing journey to get acquainted
                first. <br> <br>

                    <br> <b>1. Build up the basics</b> <br>

                    <img src="img/img guideline/gym.jpg" alt="" width="100%"></p> <br> <br>
                    First off, get fit. Include walking and stair climbing in your daily routine, add regular running
                    and
                    cycling to build base fitness and do weights to strengthen the upper body. Also, go to a climbing
                    gym to
                    get a grasp of the basics, like being able to use a harness, belaying and tying into a rope. <br>
                    <br>
                    <p style="width:60%">

                    <small>There's no getting away from winter conditions</small></p> <br>
                    Then put on a heavy rucksack and go up a hill. Do multi-day backpacking trips, practise scrambling
                    and
                    build confidence on large crags and ridges, both alone and roped with a partner. Finally, get
                    comfortable doing all that in winter conditions – because mountaineering can be very cold. <br>
                    <br><b>2. Pick your target</b> <br>
                    <p style="width:60%">
                    <img src="img/img guideline/nui .jpg" alt="" width="100%">
                    <small>Target the terrain and the exact difficulty of the climb you want</small></p> <br>
                    Consider what terrain you want to take on – technical routes, granite faces, glaciated mountains,
                    ice or
                    mixed climbing or just walk-ups. Then plan long-term goals as well as setting out your starting
                    plans.
                    <br>
                    Climbs are graded by height – in 1,000m brackets from 4Kers to 8Kers – and a class system based on
                    steepness and exposure, with 1 flat and risk-free, 2 and 3 increasing in gradient and obstacles, 4
                    involving all-fours scrambling and 5 being highly technical with rock-climbing skills. Alpine grades
                    are
                    similar, from F (Facile) through PD, AD, D, TD to ED (Extrêmement Difficile). <br>
                    Also, don’t be over ambitious. It’s better to feel good about your achievements than be disappointed
                    you’re not hitting your targets. <br> <br>
                    <b>3. Take a course</b> <br>
                    <p style="width:60%">

                    <small>A guide can teach you best practice and impart crucial mountain knowledge</small></p> <br>
                    The ‘mountain bible’ Freedom of the Hills is a good place to start and if you have mountaineering
                    friends they can teach you the basics, but nothing beats taking a course. Going out with a guide
                    puts
                    you in the mountains and gives you on-the-spot feedback and that crucial personal experience. <br>

                    Courses are usually six days on class 2-3 routes and cover route planning, navigation, safe travel,
                    rock
                    climbing and logistics like weather analysis and mountain rescue. Some also cover snow and ice,
                    including techniques for self-arrest and glacier hiking. Having all these in your locker helps you
                    become more independent in your decisions on the mountain. <br> <br>
                    <b>4. Become master of the maps</b> <br>
                    <p style="width:60%">
                    <img src="img/img guideline/nui 3.jpg" alt="" width="100%"> <br>
                    <small>Knowing how to read a map is crucial to high mountain survival</small></p> <br>
                    The more navigation experience you have the better. Practise at home by plotting a course between
                    two
                    points on any map. Plan real routes you can go out and do and find POIs you can navigate to. Use all
                    the
                    tools – GPS, compass, altimeter, map contours, triangulation, bearings and sightings. And once
                    you’re
                    confident, get lost and try to navigate back. <br>

                    Predicting your pace is crucial for planning as it helps avoid overdoing days and exhausting
                    yourself.
                    Make sure you estimate well. Measure a distance on a path near your house and pace it out – but pace
                    hill walks too so you know how it changes when it gets steeper, higher and you get more tired. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b> 5.Prepare for altitude</b> <br>
                    <p style="width:60%">
                    <img src="img/img guideline/nui 4.jpg" alt="" width="100%"> <br>
                    <small>Prepare your lungs for being at altitude</small> </p><br>
                    Any 3Ker or above and you’re likely to be affected by altitude. Don’t take it lightly. At its
                    mildest,
                    it can cause insomnia, lost appetite and nausea, all of which destroys your motivation and fitness.
                    At
                    its worst, it can lead to pulmonary edema, which floods your lungs and can be fatal. <br>
                    Acclimatisation is vital. Go up slowly, climb high and camp low and the body can often work things
                    out.
                    Rehydrate and eat, even if you don’t feel like it. And out on the trail, use pressure breathing to
                    regulate oxygen in the blood, slow your pace and take measured rhythmic steps. If you get
                    disoriented or
                    develop a cough, descend as quickly as possible. <br> <br>
                    <b> 6. Plan, plan, plan</b> <br>
                    <p style="width:60%">

                        <small>Leaving nothing to chance, be prepared for all eventualities</small>
                        </p><br>
                        Start local or in a well-travelled region with easy access to information and well-defined
                        routes.
                        Plan
                        days with pace in mind and don’t be too ambitious – a pitch or steep climb that looks easy on
                        paper
                        is
                        tougher at the end of a tiring day with a big pack, especially at altitude. Allow weather
                        contingency
                        and always have Plan B in your pocket – quite literally. <br>
                        Permits and logistics (and visas if going abroad) all need precision planning and language
                        barriers
                        can
                        make things a lot harder. <br>
                    <p style="width:60%">

                    </p>
                    When you hit the trail, go before sunrise and head down by early afternoon, especially in icy
                    regions
                    where sun melt increases the chance of rock falls through the day. Be flexible and adapt. If you end
                    up
                    having to make an unplanned bivvy high on the mountain, you’ve overdone it. <br> <br>

                    <b>7. Build your skill set slowly</b> <br>
                    <p style="width:60%">
                        <img src="img/img guideline/nui 7.jpg" alt="" width="100%"> <br>
                        <small>It's hard work, but you'll enjoy the ride when you complete a major ascent
                        </small>
                    </p> <br>
                    Build up gradually and learn as you go. Never try something out for the first time on a big trip.
                    Practise skills in a safe environment and be confident in them before you need them. You don’t need
                    to
                    be in the mountains – you can set up a crevasse rescue at home or an ice-axe arrest on a muddy bank.
                    <br>
                    It takes many trips to get a sense of reading conditions and it also takes time to learn to work
                    with
                    your partner and move together smoothly and efficiently but safely, knowing when to switch between
                    pitched climbing and short-roped hiking. <br>
                    Finally, if you feel yourself hitting a buffer, don’t be too proud to hire a guide to help take you
                    to
                    the next level. It’s safer to expand your skill set with an expert than to gamble on your own. <br>
